## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt Responsive Layout using pure CSS with great learning experience while making this project and also I did work a lot with JavaScript.

### Continued development

JavaScript, ReactJS, Python Flask, Figma, Unity

### Useful resources

- [Basic Concepts of grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout) - This helped me understand how GRID works and how to use it.
- [Responsive design made easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn-DQCifeQQ) - This Kevin Powell video is a great resource to understand de concepts of responsive designs and how to do it right.

## Acknowledgments

This challenge let me practice Grid and Flex positioning. I have much to improve but, I'm getting better every time. At first, I thought the javascript portion would be super simple but, the product cart with quantities gave me some trouble. After studying React a bit more, I will try this challenge again.
